//Day 1 remaining topics
Q1.Class loader
ClassLoader in Java is a part of JVM that loads .class files (bytecode) into memory before the program runs.

Types (short & simple):

Bootstrap ClassLoader
Loads core Java classes (like java.lang).

Extension ClassLoader
Loads classes from extension libraries.

Application ClassLoader
Loads your program’s classes from the classpath.

Short definition:
ClassLoader loads Java classes into JVM memory so they can run.


Q2.ClassLoader Code Life Cycle:

1. Loading
ClassLoader loads the .class file (bytecode) into memory.

2. Linking
Linking has 3 steps:

Verification → checks bytecode is safe

Preparation → allocates memory for static variables

Resolution → replaces symbolic references with actual memory addresses

3. Initialization

Static variables get initial values

Static blocks run

Short summary:
Loading → Linking → Initialization
This is the ClassLoader life cycle.


Q3.MetaSpace
Metaspace is the memory area in Java where class metadata (information about classes) is stored.

Short & Simple Explanation:

Metaspace stores class information, not objects.

Replaced PermGen from Java 8 onwards.

It grows dynamically (no fixed size).

Uses native memory, not JVM heap.

Why Metaspace?

Avoids “OutOfMemory: PermGen error”.

More flexible and efficient.

Shortest definition:

Metaspace = memory area where JVM stores class definitions and metadata.


//Starting with Day 2
Q1.Tokens in Java:
Smallest elements of a Java program.

Types of Tokens:
Keywords – reserved words (class, int, if)

Identifiers – names (variables, methods, classes)

Literals – constant values (10, "Hello")

Operators – +, -, *, /, ==

Separators – symbols like ; , () {} []

Comments – // or /* */

Short:
Tokens = building blocks of Java code.


Q2.Symbols in Java
Symbols in Java are characters used for structure and operations.

Common Java Symbols:

() → parentheses

{} → braces

[] → brackets

; → statement terminator

, → separator

. → access operator

= → assignment

+ - * / → arithmetic

== != > < → comparison

&& || ! → logical

: → used in loops, switch cases

" " → string

' ' → character

Short:
Symbols help Java understand structure and operations.


Q3.Comments
Comments in Java are notes in the code that Java ignores.

Types:

Single-line comment:

// This is a comment


Multi-line comment:

/* This is
   a multi-line comment */


Documentation comment (Javadoc):

/** This generates documentation */


Short:
Comments explain code; they are not executed.


Q4.Separators
Separators in Java are symbols used to separate code components.

Common Separators:

; → Ends a statement

, → Separates variables or arguments

. → Access members (object.method)

() → Method call / grouping

{} → Start & end of class, method, blocks

[] → Array declaration

: → Used in for-each loop & switch (case:)

Short:
Separators help structure the code properly.


Q5.Operators
Operators in Java are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

Types (short & simple):

Arithmetic Operators
+ - * / %

Assignment Operators
= += -= *= /=

Comparison (Relational) Operators
== != > < >= <=

Logical Operators
&& || !

Unary Operators
++ -- + - !

Bitwise Operators
& | ^ << >>

Ternary Operator
?:

Misc Operators
instanceof , new


Q6.Literals
Literals are fixed values written directly in the code.

Types of literals (short & simple):

Integer Literal → 10, -5

Floating Literal → 3.14, 2.5f

Character Literal → 'A', '5'

String Literal → "Hello"

Boolean Literal → true, false

Null Literal → null


Q7.Identifiers
Identifiers are names given to variables, methods, classes, objects, etc.

Examples:

age

sum

Student

calculateTotal()

Rules:

Cannot start with a number

No spaces

No special symbols except _ and $

Case-sensitive (Age ≠ age)

Cannot use keywords (like class, int)

Short:
Identifiers = names we give in our Java program.


Q8.Keyword
Keywords are reserved words in Java with special meaning.
You cannot use them as identifiers.

Common Java Keywords:

class, public, private, protected,static, final,if, else, switch, case,for, while, do,break, continue,return,
void,int, float, char, boolean, double,try, catch, finally,throw, throws,new, this, super,extends, implements,
import, package.

Short:
Keywords = words already defined in Java, not reusable as names.
There are 67 keywords in Java.


Q9.Type conversion
Type Conversion means changing one data type into another.

Types:
1. Implicit Conversion (Automatic / Widening)

Small → big type
Example:
int → long → float → double

Java does it automatically.

2. Explicit Conversion (Casting / Narrowing)

Big → small type
You must cast manually:

double d = 10.5;
int x = (int) d;   // 10


Short:
Implicit = automatic
Explicit = manual casting.


Q10.Access Modifier
Access Modifiers define who can access a class, method, or variable.

Types (short & simple):

public

Accessible from anywhere.

private

Accessible only within the same class.

protected

Accessible in same package + subclasses.

default (no keyword)

Accessible only in same package.

Shortest form:
public > protected > default > private (in access level).


Q11.Java code line By line explanation

class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

Line-by-line explanation:
1.class Hello {
Creates a class named Hello.

2.public static void main(String[] args)
Main method → program starts from here.

3.System.out.println("Hello World");
Prints text on the screen.


Q12.public static void main(String[] args) line-by-line explanation
public
Access modifier
Means: can be called from anywhere
JVM must access this method, so it’s public.

2. static
Belongs to the class, not object
JVM can call main without creating object.

3. void
Return type
Means: this method does not return anything.

4. main
Method name
Starting point of every Java program
JVM looks for this name to start execution.

5. String[] args
Parameter (array of String)
Used to take command-line arguments
You can write String args[] also → same meaning.

So this line means:
“A public, class-level, method named main that returns nothing and takes String array as input, where the program starts.”


Q13.System.out.println("Hello World"); Line-by-line explanation
1. System
A built-in class in Java
Belongs to java.lang package
Contains useful tools like in, out, err

2. out
A static object inside System
Represents the standard output device (your screen)
Type: PrintStream

3. println
A method inside out
Prints text and moves the cursor to the next line

4. "Hello World"
A string literal
The message that will be printed

Full Meaning (short):
System.out.println("Hello World");
→ Use Java’s system output object to print “Hello World” on the screen, then go to a new line.

Q14.Different between system.out, system.in, system.err
1. System.out
Standard output stream
Used to print on screen

Example:
System.out.println("Hello");

2. System.in
Standard input stream
Used to take input from keyboard
Example using Scanner:
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

3. System.err
Standard error stream
Used to print error messages

Example:
System.err.println("Error occurred");

Short meaning:
out → output

in → input

err → error printing


Q15.Main method
Main Method in Java is the starting point of every Java program.

Syntax
public static void main(String[] args)

Meaning:
public → JVM can access it from anywhere
static → JVM can run it without creating an object
void → does not return anything
main → name of the method JVM looks for
String[] args → takes command-line input

Short definition:
Main method is the entry point where Java program starts executing.
